# Diabetes Prediction Project

Overview:

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting diabetes in Pima Indian women aged 21 years and older. The project utilizes various classification algorithms, with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) ultimately selected as the final predictive model.

Dataset:

The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, available in the 'data' folder as 'diabetes.csv'.

Results:

SVM achieved the highest accuracy (approximately 82) for diabetes prediction.
Notable feature importance: 'Glucose' and 'BMI' significantly influence predictions.
